## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **FHE Performance**: Heavy computation for bid comparisons
   - Mitigation: Optimize algorithms, use batching
2. **Gas Costs**: High costs for encrypted operations
   - Mitigation: L2 deployment, operation batching
3. **Complexity**: Multiple auction types increase complexity
   - Mitigation: Modular architecture, extensive testing

### Business Risks
1. **User Adoption**: Users unfamiliar with encrypted auctions
   - Mitigation: Education, simple UX, clear benefits
2. **Competition**: Existing auction platforms
   - Mitigation: Focus on privacy features, niche markets
3. **Regulatory**: Auction regulations vary by jurisdiction
   - Mitigation: Legal review, compliance framework

## Dependencies

### External
- Zama fhEVM network availability
- TFHE.js library stability
